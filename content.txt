Elizabeth Cassara: Background and Ambitions

Hello, my name is Elizabeth. I'm from Bartlett, Illinois, and
have lived there my whole life. I have four older siblings,
divorced parents, and a loving boyfriend Marcus of 2.5 years.
I have a passion for animals including; ferrets, rats, birds,
cats, dogs, cows, goats, monkeys, sugar gliders, and many
more!

I am currently a fourth year Mechanical Engineer major at
Illinois Tech and will graduate with my Bachelor's this
May (2020). During my last semester in school I look forward
to completing hands-on projects for my Mechanical Engineering
classes as well as broaden my knowledge with my humanities and
social science classes.

After graduating I plan on spending a couple months with my
family in Bartlett before I move to The Quad Cities where I'll
be staring my new job. I'm going to be beginning as a
Manufacturing Engineer for 8 eight months before switching
to Quality Engineer. I look forward to learning more about
all of the endless possibilities as a Mechanical Engineer as
well as paying off my debt.
