    <h1>Elizabeth Cassara: Background and Ambitions</h1>
      <p class="tab">
        Hello, my name is Elizabeth. I’m from Bartlett, Illinois, and
        have lived there my whole life. I have four older siblings,
        divorced parents, and a loving boyfriend, Marcus, of 2.5 years.
        I have a passion for animals including; ferrets, rats, birds,
        cats, dogs, cows, goats, monkeys, sugar gliders, and many
        more! When I move after graduation, my frist priority is to rent a home where they
        allow pets so I can get pet rats or ferrets.

              I am currently a fourth year Mechanical Engineer major at
        Illinois Tech and will graduate with my Bachelor’s this
        May (2020). During my last semester in school I look forward
        to completing hands-on projects for my Mechanical Engineering
        classes as well as broadening my knowledge with my humanities and
        social science classes. Besides Web Design, I am taking Social
        Psychology and Governments and Politics in Africa.
      </p>
      <p class="tab">
              After graduating I plan on spending a couple months with my
        family in Bartlett before I move to the Quad Cities where I’ll
        be staring my new job. I’m going to be beginning as a
        Manufacturing Engineer for eight months before switching
        to Quality Engineering. I look forward to learning more about
        all of the endless possibilities as a Mechanical Engineer as
        well as paying off my debt.
